# docker-mysql4

A docker image for MySQL4

Though there exists new MySQL distributions just like MySQL5, MySQL6, there
still have lots mature program needs a MySQL4 environment.

I think MySQL4 is too old for compile as 64bits, so we build this MySQL4 in
64bits docker image with 32bits gcc mode to ensure there less problems.

## Usage

```bash
docker run -it --rm  -p 3306:3306 -v /srv/mysql:/var/lib/mysql starofrainnight/mysql4
```

## Ports

- 3306 : Database Service Port

## Volumes

Data Directory: `/var/lib/mysql`

If the data directory is empty, new sub-directories `data` and `conf` will be
generated under the parent `mysql` directory.

`data` directory stored mysql database file, and `conf` at least contained a
config file for mysql4 : `my.conf` .

So the directory structure looks like:

    /var/lib/mysql
        |
        +---- data
        |       |
        |       +---- ...
        |
        +---- conf
        |      |
        |      +---- my.conf
        |
        ...

## Environment

Here are environment variables that could be set to change internal behaviors:

- TZ : The time zone settings

## Acknowledgement

There are similar projects in docker-hub (Search by the keyword "mysql4"), mostly forked from â€‹[Thomas Dressler's mysql4 docker project](https://github.com/Tommi2Day/mysql4) .

This project also inspired by his project, thanks!
